# Habitat For Humanity Learning Management System (Phase 3)

In Phase 3, we will design and implement an interactive module aimed at enhancing the learning experience by 
allowing learners to test their knowledge through engaging and dynamic activities. This module will incorporate 
elements of gamification to create an enjoyable and motivational learning environment.

Leveraging cutting-edge tools and technologies, we will use Three.js to develop visually captivating and interactive 
3D experiences. Integration with Google Classroom will ensure seamless connectivity with existing educational resources 
and streamline user access. Additionally, Blender will be utilized to create and optimize custom 3D assets that enrich 
the module's visual and interactive appeal.

This phase will focus on combining creativity and functionality to deliver an engaging, learner-focused solution that 
aligns with Habitat for Humanity New Brunswick’s educational goals. By implementing this module, we aim to provide learners 
with a hands-on, interactive way to assess their knowledge while fostering a deeper connection to the program's content.
